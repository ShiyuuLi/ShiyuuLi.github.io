I am a second-year master's student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My supervisor is [Prof. Yuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rWSrzsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from UESTC. My research interests broadly lie in applied cryptography and security.
