I am currently in the third year of my master's degree program at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I am fortunate to have [Prof. Yuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rWSrzsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) as my advisor. I am also fortunately mentored by [Prof. Kan Yang](https://kan-yang.github.io). I received my Bachelor's degree from UESTC. I have a broad interest in cryptography and security, and I will find a focus when I become a PhD student :).
