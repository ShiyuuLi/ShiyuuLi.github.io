I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at University of Virginia, advised by Prof. [Wei-Kai Lin](https://weikailin.github.io). I got my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), advised by Prof. [Yuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rWSrzsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). 

I am interested in cryptography in general, particularly in exploring lower bounds/separations.
