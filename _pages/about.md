I am a second-year master's student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Yuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rWSrzsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I am also fortunately mentored by [Prof. Kan Yang](https://cs.memphis.edu/~kanyang/). I received my Bachelor's degree from UESTC. I have a broad interest in applied cryptography and security, and I will find a focus when I become a PhD student :).
